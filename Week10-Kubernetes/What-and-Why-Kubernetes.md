### Kubernetes

An open-source system for orchestering container deployments.

It helps us in:

1. Automatic Deployment
2. Scaling & Load Balancing
3. Management

`Kubernetes is like Docker-Compose for multiple machines.`

#### What Kubernetes will do?

1. Create your object (like pods) and manage them.
2. Monitor pods and re-create them, scale pods, etc.
3. Kubernetes utlizes the provided (cloud) resources to apply our configurations.
