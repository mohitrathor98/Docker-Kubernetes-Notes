## Installation

- A cluster needs one management or master node and one or more compute node.
- We can also have all the things on a single master node.
- However, this won't be inefficient solution.

We need following tools installed.

1. Docker on all nodes.
2. kubelet on all compute nodes.
3. kubectl for sending instructions to master and compute nodes.


### Minikube

- Helps in simulating the cluster for devlopment or learning purposes.
